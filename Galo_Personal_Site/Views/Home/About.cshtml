                        I'm a highly dedicated, organized, and detail-oriented individual with excellent technical, analytical, and communication skills.
                        Motivated and self-driven, I like to always push my limits and see how far I can get.<br /><br /> I'm originative of Mexico,
                        and because I embrace my ethnical background, I've come to appreciate other people's backgrounds and culture: giving me the ability to easily
                        transcending cultural differences. I speak both English and Spanish fluently, and much enjoy my country's cuisine more than others.<br /><br />
                        Technology and information have always been my passion and what better to combine them than through programming.
